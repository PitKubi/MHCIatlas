Package: MHCIatlas
Type: Package
Title: Package to reproduce data analysis and further explore the data depicted by Kubiniok et al. 2020 in 
        'Global Analysis of the Mammalian MHC class I Immunopeptidome at the Organism-Wide Scale'.
Version: 0.1.0

Description: This R package is supplementary to the publication 'Global Analysis of the Mammalian MHC class I Immunopeptidome at the Organism-Wide Scale'
        in which publicly available datasets of human and mouse MHCI peptide tissue drafts are co-analyzed with organism-wide human and mouse
        proteomics (protein expression atlases) and mRNA (mRNA expression atlases) datasets. This package allows the reproduction of the analysis
        depicted by Kubiniok et al. (2020) and also allows further exploration of the approaches taken.
